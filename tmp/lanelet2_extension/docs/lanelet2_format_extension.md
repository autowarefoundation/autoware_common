# Modifying Lanelet2 format for Autoware

## Overview

About the basics of the default format, please refer to main [Lanelet2 repository](https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/Lanelet2). (see [here](https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/Lanelet2/blob/master/lanelet2_core/doc/LaneletPrimitives.md) about primitives)

In addition to default Lanelet2 Format, users should add following mandatory/optional tags to their osm lanelet files as explained in reset of this document.
Users may use `autoware_lanelet2_validation` [node](../README.md#nodes) to check if their maps are valid.

The following is the extra format added for Autoware:

- [extra regulatory elements](extra_regulatory_elements.md)
  - Detection Area
  - Road Marking
- [extra lanelet subtype](extra_lanelet_subtypes.md)
  - Roadside Lane

## Mandatory Tags

### Elevation Tags

Elevation("ele") information for points(`node`) is optional in default Lanelet2 format.
However, some of Autoware packages(e.g. trafficlight_recognizer) need elevation to be included in HD map. Therefore, users must make sure that all points in their osm maps contain elevation tags.

Here is an example osm syntax for node object.

```xml
<node id='1' visible='true' version='1' lat='49.00501435943' lon='8.41687458512'>
  <tag k='ele' v='3.0'/> <!-- this tag is mandatory for Autoware!! -->
</node>
```

### TrafficLights

Default Lanelet2 format uses LineString(`way`) or Polygon class to represent the shape of a traffic light. For Autoware, traffic light objects must be represented only by LineString to avoid confusion, where start point is at bottom left edge and end point is at bottom right edge. Also, "height" tag must be added in order to represent the size in vertical direction (not the position).

The Following image illustrates how LineString is used to represent shape of Traffic Light in Autoware.
![How LineString is used to represent shape of Traffic Light in Autoware](traffic_light.png)

Here is an example osm syntax for traffic light object.

```xml
<way id='13' visible='true' version='1'>
  <nd ref='6' />
  <nd ref='5' />
  <tag k='type' v='traffic_light' />
  <tag k='subtype' v='red_yellow_green' />
  <tag k='height' v='0.5'/> <!-- this tag is mandatory for Autoware!! -->
</way>
```

### Turn Directions

Users must add "turn_direction" tags to lanelets within intersections to indicate vehicle's turning direction. You do not need this tags for lanelets that are not in intersections. If you do not have this tag, Autoware will not be able to light up turning indicators.
This tags only take following values:

- left
- right
- straight

Following image illustrates how lanelets should be tagged.

![Turn Directions: How lanelets should be tagged](turn_direction.png)

Here is an example of osm syntax for lanelets in intersections.

```xml
<relation id='1' visible='true' version='1'>
  <member type='way' ref='2' role='left' />
  <member type='way' ref='3' role='right' />
  <member type='relation' ref='4' role='regulatory_element' />
  <tag k='location' v='urban' />
  <tag k='one_way' v='yes' />
  <tag k='subtype' v='road' />
  <tag k='type' v='lanelet' />
  <tag k='turn_direction' v='left' /> <!-- this tag is mandatory for lanelets at intersections!! -->
</relation>
```

### Right Of Way

Users must add `right_of_way` tag to intersection lanes, namely lanes with `turn_direction` attribute. Below image illustrates how to set yield lanes(orange) for the ego lane(blue).

![RightOfWay tagging](right_of_way.drawio.svg)

Basically intersection lanes which are:

- left/right turn
- straight and on the side of priority sign

need this tag to know which lanes in their `conflicting lanes` can be ignored for object detection.

left/right turning lane is often conflicting with lanes whose traffic lights are red when its traffic light is green, so **at least** those lanes should be registered as yield lanes.

If ego car is going straight the intersection when the traffic light is green, then it does not need to care other lanes because it has the highest priority. But if the traffic lights do not exist and ego lane is on the side of priority road, then yield lanes should be set to explicitly ignore part of conflicting lanes.

## Optional Taggings

Following tags are optional tags that you may want to add depending on how you want to use your map in Autoware.

### Meta Info

Users may add the `MetaInfo` element to their OSM file to indicate format version and map version of their OSM file. This information is not meant to influence Autoware vehicle's behavior, but is published as ROS message so that developers could know which map was used from ROSBAG log files. MetaInfo elements exists in the same hierarchy with `node`, `way`, and `relation` elements, otherwise JOSM wouldn't be able to load the file correctly.

Here is an example of MetaInfo in osm file:

```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<osm version='0.6' generator='JOSM'>
  <MetaInfo format_version='1.0' map_version='1.0'/>
  <node>...</node>
  <way>...</way>
  <relation>...</relation>
</osm>
```

### Local Coordinate Expression

Sometimes users might want to create Lanelet2 maps that are not georeferenced.
In such a case, users may use "local_x", "local_y" taggings to express local positions instead of latitude and longitude.
You will need to `lanelet2_map_projector_type` to `local`, then [autoware map loader](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/tree/main/map/map_loader#lanelet2_map_loader) will overwrite x,y positions with these tags when they are present.
For z values, use "ele" tags as default Lanelet2 Format.
You would still need to fill in lat and lon attributes so that parser does not crush, but their values could be anything.

Here is example `node` element in osm with "local_x", "local_y" taggings:

```xml
<!-- lat/lon attributes are required, but their values can be anything -->
<node id='40648' visible='true' version='1' lat='0' lon='0'>
  <tag k='local_x' v=2.54'/>
  <tag k='local_y' v=4.38'/>
  <tag k='ele' v='3.0'/>
</node>
```

### Light Bulbs in Traffic Lights

Default Lanelet format can only express shape (base + height) of traffic lights.
However, region_tlr node in Autoware uses positions of each light bulbs to recognize color of traffic light. If users may wish to use this node, "light_bulbs"(`way`) element must be registered to traffic_light regulatory_element object define position and color of each light bulb in traffic lights. If you are using other trafficlight_recognizer nodes(e.g. tlr_mxnet), which only uses bounding box of traffic light, then you do not need to add this object.

"light_bulbs" object is defined using LineString(`way`), and each node of line string is placed at the center of each light bulb. Also, each node should have "color" and optionally "arrow" tags to describe its type. Also, "traffic_light_id" tag is used to indicate which ID of relevant traffic_light element.

"color" tag is used to express the color of the light bulb. Currently only three values are used:

- red
- yellow
- green

"arrow" tag is used to express the direction of the arrow of light bulb:

- up
- right
- left
- up_right
- up_left

Following image illustrates how "light_bulbs" LineString should be created.

![How "light_bulbs" LineString should be created](light_bulbs.png)

Here is an example of osm syntax for light_bulb object:

```xml
<node id=1 version='1' lat='49.00541994701' lon='8.41565013855'>
  <tag k='ele' v='5'/>
  <tag k='color' v='red'/>
</node>
<node id=2 version='1' lat='49.00542091657' lon='8.4156469497'>
  <tag k='ele' v='5'/>
  <tag k='color' v='yellow'/>
</node>
<node id=3 version='1' lat='49.00542180052' lon='8.41564400223'>
  <tag k='ele' v='5'/>
  <tag k='color' v='green'/>
</node>
<node id=3 version='1' lat='49.00542180052' lon='8.41564400223'>
  <tag k='ele' v='4.6'/>
  <tag k='color' v='green'/>
  <tag k=arrow v='right'/>
</node>
<way id=11 version='1'>
  <nd ref=1 />
  <nd ref=2 />
  <nd ref=3 />
  <tag k='traffic_light_id' v='10'/> <!-- id of linestring with type="traffic_light" -->
  <tag k='type' v='light_bulbs' />
</way>
```

After creating "light_bulbs" elements, you have to register them to traffic_light regulatory element as role "light_bulbs".
The following illustrates how light_bulbs are registered to traffic_light regulatory elements.

![How light_bulbs are registered to traffic_light regulatory elements](traffic_light_regulatory_element.png)

```xml
<relation id='8' visible='true' version='1'>
  <tag k='type' v='regulatory_element' />
  <tag k='subtype' v='traffic_light' />
  <member type='way' ref='9' role='ref_line' />
  <member type='way' ref='10' role='refers' /> <!-- refers to the traffic light line string -->
  <member type='way' ref='11' role='light_bulbs'/> <!-- refers to the light_bulb line string -->
</relation>
```

### Crosswalk

Original Lanelet2 format only requires `subtype=crosswalk` tag to be specified in the corresponding lanelet. However, Autoware requires a regulatory element to be defined on top of that in order to:

- explicitly define the relevant driving lanes even in 3D environment
- optionally define stop lines associated with the crosswalk
- enable accurate definition of complex polygons for crosswalk

For the details, refer to this [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/autowarefoundation/discussions/3036).
Crosswalk regulatory element can be tied to `ref_line`, `crosswalk_polygon` and `refers`.

![crosswalk_regulatory elements](crosswalk_regulatory_element.svg)

- `ref_line`: Stop line for the crosswalk.
- `crosswalk_polygon`: Accurate area of the crosswalk.
- `refers`: Lanelet that indicates the moving direction of crosswalk users.

_An example:_

```xml
<relation id="10751">
  <member type="way" role="ref_line" ref="8123"/>
  <member type="way" role="crosswalk_polygon" ref="4047"/>
  <member type="relation" role="refers" ref="2206"/>
  <tag k="type" v="regulatory_element"/>
  <tag k="subtype" v="crosswalk"/>
</relation>
```

### Traffic Lights for Crosswalks

It can define not only traffic lights for vehicles but also for crosswalk users by using regulatory element. In this case, the crosswalk lanelet needs to refer the traffic light regulatory element.

![crosswalk_traffic_light](crosswalk_traffic_light.svg)

_An example:_

```xml
<way id="179745">
  <nd ref="179743"/>
  <nd ref="179744"/>
  <tag k="type" v="traffic_light"/>
  <tag k="subtype" v="solid"/>
  <tag k="height" v="0.5"/>
</way>

...

<relation id="179750">
  <member type="way" role="refers" ref="179745"/>
  <member type="way" role="refers" ref="179756"/>
  <tag k="type" v="regulatory_element"/>
  <tag k="subtype" v="traffic_light"/>
</relation>

...

<relation id="1556">
  <member type="way" role="left" ref="1449"/>
  <member type="way" role="right" ref="1450"/>
  <member type="relation" role="regulatory_element" ref="179750"/>
  <tag k="type" v="lanelet"/>
  <tag k="subtype" v="crosswalk"/>
  <tag k="speed_limit" v="10"/>
  <tag k="location" v="urban"/>
  <tag k="one_way" v="no"/>
  <tag k="participant:pedestrian" v="yes"/>
</relation>
```

### Safety Slow Down for Crosswalks

If you wish ego vehicle to slow down to a certain speed from a certain distance while passing over a
certain crosswalk _even though there are no target objects around it_, you can add following tags to
the crosswalk definition on lanelet2 map:

- `safety_slow_down_speed` **[m/s]**: The speed you want ego vehicle to drive at while passing over
  the crosswalk
- `safety_slow_down_distance` **[m]**: The distance between front bumper of ego vehicle and
  closest point to the crosswalk when ego vehicle slows down and drives at specified speed

_An example:_

```xml
<relation id='34378' visible='true' version='1'>
  <member type='way' ref='34374' role='left' />
  <member type='way' ref='34377' role='right' />
  <tag k='subtype' v='crosswalk' />
  <tag k='safety_slow_down_speed' v='3.0' />
  <tag k='safety_slow_down_distance' v='2.0' />
  <tag k='type' v='lanelet' />
</relation>
```

### No Obstacle Segmentation Area

If there is a polygon area that has `no_obstacle_segmentation_area` tag, the obstacle points in this area are removed.
If you want to ignore points for a certain module, you have to define another tag and specify it in the parameter of vector_map_inside_area_filter.
Currently, following tags are defined other than `no_obstacle_segmentation_area`.

- `no_obstacle_segmentation_area_for_run_out`
  - remove points for run out module

_An example:_

```xml
  <way id="1658">
    <nd ref="1653"/>
    <nd ref="1654"/>
    <nd ref="1656"/>
    <nd ref="1657"/>
    <tag k="type" v="no_obstacle_segmentation_area"/>
    <tag k="area" v="yes"/>
  </way>
```

### Hatched Road Markings Area

The area with `hatched_road_markings` tag can be used for avoiding obstacles when there is not enough space to avoid.
Note that in some countries, it is forbidden for vehicles to go inside the area.

_An example:_

```xml
  <way id="9933">
    <nd ref="2058"/>
    <nd ref="2059"/>
    <nd ref="1581"/>
    <nd ref="2057"/>
    <nd ref="4925"/>
    <nd ref="4923"/>
    <nd ref="4921"/>
    <nd ref="4920"/>
    <tag k="type" v="hatched_road_markings"/>
    <tag k="area" v="yes"/>
  </way>
```

### No Stopping Area

The area with `no_stopping_area` tag can be used to prohibit even a few seconds of stopping, even for traffic jams or at traffic lights.
The ref_line can be set arbitrarily, and the ego-vehicle should stop at this line if it cannot pass through the area.

_An example:_

```xml
  <way id='9853' visible='true' version='1'>
    <nd ref='9849' />
    <nd ref='9850' />
    <nd ref='9851' />
    <nd ref='9852' />
    <tag k='area' v='yes' />
    <tag k='type' v='no_stopping_area' />
  </way>

  <relation id='9854' visible='true' version='1'>
    <member type='way' ref='9853' role='refers' />
    <member type='way' ref='9848' role='ref_line' />
    <tag k='subtype' v='no_stopping_area' />
    <tag k='type' v='regulatory_element' />
  </relation>
```

### No Parking Area

The area with `no_parking_area` tag can be used to prohibit parking. Stopping for a few seconds is allowed in this area.

_An example:_

```xml
  <way id='9853' visible='true' version='1'>
    <nd ref='9849' />
    <nd ref='9850' />
    <nd ref='9851' />
    <nd ref='9852' />
    <tag k='area' v='yes' />
    <tag k='type' v='no_parking_area' />
  </way>

  <relation id='9854' visible='true' version='1'>
    <member type='way' ref='9853' role='refers' />
    <tag k='subtype' v='no_parking_area' />
    <tag k='type' v='regulatory_element' />
  </relation>
```

### No Drivable Lane

A no drivable lane is a lanelet or more that are out of operation design domain (ODD), i.e., the vehicle **must not** drive autonomously in this/these lanelet/s.  
A lanelet becomes no drivable by adding an optional tag under the relevant lanelet in the map file `<tag k="no_drivable_lane" v="yes"/>`.

_An example:_

```xml
<relation id="2621">
    <member type="way" role="left" ref="2593"/>
    <member type="way" role="right" ref="2620"/>
    <tag k="type" v="lanelet"/>
    <tag k="subtype" v="road"/>
    <tag k="speed_limit" v="30.00"/>
    <tag k="location" v="urban"/>
    <tag k="one_way" v="yes"/>
    <tag k="participant:vehicle" v="yes"/>
    <tag k="no_drivable_lane" v="yes"/>
  </relation>
```

For more details about the `no_drivable_lane` concept and design, please refer to the [**_no-drivable-lane-design_**](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe/blob/main/planning/behavior_velocity_no_drivable_lane_module/README.md) document.
